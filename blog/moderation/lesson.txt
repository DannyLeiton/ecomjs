-> Moderation is easier to implement in the Client app, but not if the filte list changes frequently.
              -> easier to implemente in the comments service, but let's add a new microservice.
-> It might take a long time for the new service to moderate a comment.

Comment Moderation Statuses:  Pending, Approved, Rejected

Think of event types: 
CommentModerated, comment.status = 'approved'
CommentUpvoted, comment.upvotes += 1
CommentDownvoted, comment.downvotes += 1
CommentPromoted, comment.promoted = true
CommentAnonymized, comment.userId = null
CommentSearchable, comment.searchable = true
CommentAdvertised, comment.advertised = true

Generic event type for the Query Service => CommentUpdated
