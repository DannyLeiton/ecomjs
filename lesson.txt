Why do Microservices follow DB-Per-Service approach?
1. Each service should run independently of other services.
2. DB schemas/structure might change unexpectedly.
3. Some services might function more efficiently with different types of DBs (sql vs nosql).

How can we tackle this challenge?
-> Communication Strategies Between Services:
  -> Sync: Services communicate with each other using direct requests:
    -> Conceptually easy to understand.
    -> A service only needing info from other services won't need a db.
    -> Introduces a dependecy between services.
    -> If any inter-sercie request fails, th overall request fails.
    -> The entire request is only as fast as the slowest request.
    -> Can easily introduce webs of requests.

  -> Async: Services communicate with each other using events:
    -> Uses an Event Bus to emit and receive messages. (This looks like Kafka).
    -> Have dependent services listening to the event bus when some of its dependency services, and record that to its own db with the structure it needs.
